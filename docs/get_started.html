					<i><b>Introduction:</b></i>
				</p>
				<p>
					When starting in the wonderful world of pet training there are many things that may go through your head. For instance, you could be thinking to yourself, “What kind of treats are right for my dog?”, “How do I even start?”, or maybe even “What do I do to get my dog to listen?”. 
					With so much information available on the internet today, it is very easy to get confused and not know what is right and what is wrong. Hopefully, this getting started guide will help you understand what to expect, what you need, and how to do it. 
                </p>
				<p>
					So, you just brought your new puppy or dog home and are eager to get them started in the first steps to what will be a wonderful experience for you and your dog. Nothing will help strengthen the bond between you and your pooch more than regular training, exercise, and love (well maybe food too!).
					 You can expect to spend a lot of time training your dog, but that’s a good thing! Not only will you get plenty of one-on-one time with your pup, but you will also be encouraging the growth of their mental and physical health.
                </p>
				<p>
					<i><b>What do I need to get started?:</b></i>
                </p>
				<p>
					To get started with training you only need a few supplies. 
					You will need:

					<li>Yummy treats such as (00000)</li>
					<li>A quality clicker</li>
					<li>Patience</li>
					<li>And a dog of course!</li>
                </p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Does the age/breed of my dog matter:</b></i>
                </p>
				<p>
					I for one hate the saying “You can’t teach an old dog a new trick”. Not only is this a COMPLETE LIE, but it also causes people to assume they shouldn’t adopt an older dog as it won’t be able to be trained. 
					Older dogs may have some issues that a previous owner may have caused, but most of the time, that can be worked through with time. Take Maxx here for example, He was a rescue I adopted at 6 years old.
				</p>
				<img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="/assets/Post pictures/older dog.jpeg" alt="Training a husky dog to sit on command">
				<blockquote>
					
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Maxx, a Border Collie and Golden Retriever mix, was a great dog who deserved everything good that could be given to him. Before I adopted Maxx, he had 6 previous owners, unfortunately for Maxx, the previous owners saw him as to much work, so he kept getting surrendered to the pound over and over. One or some of these owners had gravely abused Maxx in his past, this led to a fear and anxiety-fueled lifestyle. Poor Maxx would wet himself and shake if someone raised their voice or made sudden movements. 
					With some patience, training, and a whole lot of LOVE, a few years later, Maxx was the best dog anyone could ever ask for, and an even better friend. For the next 3 years, Maxx lived a great and rewarding life until his unfortunate passing earlier this year.
				</p>
				<img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="/assets/Post pictures/" alt="">
				<p>
					If you are worried about having the right breed of dog for training, don’t be! While some breeds may pick up faster, all dogs can learn most behaviors. Make sure before you have adopted a dog that you have extensively researched the breed and understand what your pet is known for. Some breeds are highly intelligent and may excel at many different training categories. Others may prefer to be lazy and train less often, but this doesn’t mean they still can’t be a whole lot of fun to work with!  
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					If you like Belgian Malinois, my family just adopted one, Achilles! We will be starting training in mid-November. I will be updating all of my guides with videos and showing his regular progress updates as we go along.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					<i><b>When/what should I start training?:</b></i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Do you already have your pet? Then you’ve already started! If not, the moment you bring your puppy home, training has started. There are a lot of possibilities for where to start. Depending on your pet’s age or previous ownership, you may want to start potty training first while working on crate and name training. This will build a solid foundation for your dog and get them started on the right track for learning. Next, you can move on to more basic commands such as Sit, Come, and Crawl. 
					Next, move on to some tricks! You can start with jumping through a hoop (5 months old minimum), playing dead, or shake. Once they’ve learned these, we can move on to even harder ticks that get more and more exciting.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>What is this clicker thing for?:</b></i>
				</p>
			<p>
				Clickers are a simple device with just a push button. When you push the button, the device will emit a loud audible clicking noise. We will be using this as a way to make a connection to our treats. Money has value to humans as food/treats have value to animals. We will be using the clicker to make a noise when we are reaching the targeted behavior. For instance, if we are teaching a dog to roll over, we will NOT be forcefully positioning our furry friend. Instead, we will be using treats to lure them into doing it on their own. Little by little as the dog is moving toward the desired action we will click and reward them with a treat. Clicks should always be given with treats, if you fail to treat your pooch when clicking they will become confused as they associate the noise with getting a reward
			</p>
			<p>
				If your boss told you “You’re doing great work, here’s a raise!” Then you find out you aren’t getting one, you would be really frustrated too.
			</p>
				<p>
					No, you will not need to always use the clicker or use it forever.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Where is the best place to train my dog?:</b></i>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Contrary to what others may tell you, the best place to train your dog is at home, by YOU. Don’t be fooled by all the trainers out there looking to make a quick buck (or a couple thousand) off of you. If you have the time, the training should be done by the dog owner.
					 Training is an important part of dog ownership, one that will lead you on a wonderful journey where both of you will bond and gain a deep connection that lasts a lifetime. Do you really want them associating that bond with some stranger you paid $50 an hour to train your dog? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only will you save money and make a deep connection with your pet. You will learn valuable skills that will help you in all walks of life. Training can be done by anyone! Yes, anyone!  You don’t need a degree or fancy education to train animals. All you need to do is research and put in the effort and time. Now you may be thinking “Well, John Smith took his dog to We Train Dogs and he is super well-behaved”. While that may be the case now, John may soon find his furry friend less and less responsive to the commands over time. 
					If a dog isn’t trained regularly and consistently the behaviors we target can fade over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Start training slowly and keep the training sessions to around 15 minutes at a time. Dogs have short attention spans and can become bored easily. If you drone the session on for hours, your pet won’t be learning anything. Some breeds can have multiple training sessions in a day, some will prefer every other day, and others may find 3 times a week to be sufficient. 
					Keep the training area free of distractions, and most importantly keep yourself calm and collected. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Why is regular exercise important for training?:</b></i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only is making sure that your dog is getting enough exercise good for physical health, it’s also good for improving training sessions! Some dog breeds require hours of exercise a day. They can become uninterested, uncomfortable, and unhealthy if they are lacking quality exercise. 
					They can also develop awful behavioral issues such as barking, chewing on things other than toys, digging, and even anxiety.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your pup is getting enough exercise, they will have their needs met better and be more willing to learn new behaviors. Physical activity is the main factor that contributes to mental stimulation as well as proper nutrition. Keep your dog well-fed and exercised and training will go smoothly and efficiently.
					 It will also reduce the amount of training needed as it will prevent a lot of bad behaviors. Make sure you can keep up with your pet before adopting and investigate as many breeds as possible before selecting a dog. For instance, don’t pick a Belgian Malinois if you spend most of your time on the couch or out of the house. If you are very active and want your pet to join your active lifestyle (which you should) don’t pick something like a bulldog.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>How do I properly discipline my dog?:</b></i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Did you ever have a dog growing up? Did your parents discipline them by rubbing their noses in a mess, yelling at them, not feeding them, or even physically hitting them? The very unfortunate answer to this is usually yes. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>This is abuse.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do or plan on treating your animal like this, do the world a favor and just don’t get an animal. If you see someone treating an animal like this, please report it. In my experience, some people tend to think of animals as objects they own, and not members of their families. Some of you reading this are thinking “Well, my pappy raised Spot this way and he was a great dog.” While Spot could have been a fantastic dog, fear is the worst motivator that you can give a dog, harming them is the worst thing you could ever do. 
					Would you like being hit when you make a mistake by someone 10x your size? You will find love, respect, and some yummy treats work faster, better, and safer.
				</p>
				<img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="/assets/Post pictures/White dog being loved.jpeg" alt="">
				<p>
					When your dog does something you do not approve of, take a second to breathe and calm down. For this example, we will assume that your dog has started to chew on something they shouldn’t. What we want to do here is not yell at them but say “NO” with a firm voice and introduce a distraction like their chew toy. They will quickly catch onto what they can and can’t chew on. If your dog is doing something you do not approve of, tell them “NO” in a firm voice. Then introduce a distraction such as a chew toy. Quickly they will pick up on what isn’t and is okay. 
					Do not use a crate as punishment as the crate should be a dog’s safe space.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>The secret to dog training:</b></i>
				</p>
				<p>
					With all my dog training guides, I try to include some form or version of this part to drive the material home. This is the secret to dog training and why so many fail to correctly train their pup. The secret is a simple three-word acronym I call ORA. ORA, (pronounced like Aura) stands for Obedience, Respect, and Authority.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Obedience</b> – Your dog must be able to follow your commands. If your dog isn’t obedient, you’ve got a real problem on your hands that needs correcting. By keeping this in mind, make sure that all good behavior is rewarded with praise, and that all bad behavior is met with a firm NO. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Respect</b> – Remember, dogs are family first, performers second. Treat your pet with respect and expect it in return. Never ever yell or raise your voice toward your dog as this will do you far more harm than good. Maintaining a calm demeanor and using praise as a positive enforcer, will lead to a happy furry friend. Make sure to show them plenty of attention and love.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Authority </b>– Treating your dog with respect doesn’t mean you can’t show them who is and isn’t in charge here. Remember, YOU are the alpha. Dogs are pack animals; pack animals have leaders known as the alpha. Your dog will look to you for guidance on what is allowed and what isn’t acceptable. If you aren’t firm and are seen as a pushover, you can expect the dog to take advantage of that. For example, if you are sitting down for dinner, and your dog wants some of your meal, they will start whining for it. If you give in and give them some, you’ve just reinforced bad behavior. You can expect your dog to whine every time you sit down to eat now. This is why being firm and remembering to say NO is a key factor in training.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i><b>Outro:</b></i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Wow, that was a lot of info, wasn’t it? Now that we understand the basics and what we should and shouldn’t do with your pup, you are now ready to take the plunge! Congratulate yourself on taking the first steps in the path of dog training and get out there and have some fun with your pet. If you take anything from this article, I hope that it’s this: 
				</p>
				<p>
					Dog training is something anyone can do and is a fantastic way to build a bond with your pet that lasts a lifetime.
