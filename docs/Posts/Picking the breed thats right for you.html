                    Are you ready to make a huge decision? One that will last many years and change your life entirely? You may think so, but have you really considered all the possibilities and responsibilities? 
                    When you decide you are ready to take on the huge responsibility of adopting a dog for you and your family, one of the first things you should answer is: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i><b>What type of home do I have?</b></i>
                </p>
				<p>
                    Do you live in an apartment in a large city? Or maybe you own a home in the countryside. Is your home large enough to accommodate a Great Dane? Do you have a yard with a fence where a dog could roam free for plenty of exercise? 
                </p>
				<p>
                    When looking through all the many many breeds of dogs, you will notice that each and every breed has different characteristics. For instance, compare a German shepherd to a Yorkshire Terrier. 
                </p>
                <img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="/assets/Post pictures/German shepherd.jpg" alt="Training a husky dog to sit on command">
                <img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="/assets/Post pictures/yorkie.jpg" alt="Training a husky dog to sit on command">
				<p>
					The only things these dogs have in common besides species are similar colors, and both have tails, and four legs (most of the time). One typically weighs 7 pounds, while the other can push 90 pounds. One is energetic, the other starves for activity. 
                    So, while you may want a larger dog, if you live in a smaller home or do not have the space or means to properly accommodate your dream dog, it would be better for you (and the dog) to choose a breed that better fits your living situation.
                </p>
				<p>
					All right, you’ve analyzed your home, you’ve assessed your space, and you are ready to find a dog! … NOPE. As exciting as it is, there are still more factors to consider. Now, the second thing to consider is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i><b>How active am I?</b></i>
                </p>
				<p>
					Are you the type of person to go walking every morning before work? Are you the type of person that loves to get out and about? Many breeds crave activity, while others prefer to laze in the sun for hours. This is a very big step you are taking, if you can’t keep up with the dog’s physical needs, the dog will never see its full potential, or may not be happy with the lifestyle. 
                    Therefore, it’s important to have a fenced-in backyard for your dog to run around and play, when you can’t help with the exercise you can allow the dog to tire themselves out safely.
				</p>
				<p>
                    The next thing to consider in your journey is:
                </p>

				<p>
					<i><b>How much money do you have to spend on a dog? Where should I look to buy my new pet?</b></i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Many breeds of dogs are heavily sought after, some puppies can even cost upward of $10k depending on breed, and genetics. For example, typically, a full-blooded dog with papers of authenticity will have records of parents for many generations, showing the dog’s lineage. This combined with demand can really drive the price up. As always, I recommend avoiding these types of breeders at all costs. 
                    Dogs are animals, they have feelings, and they are not toys ((insert toy poodle) well some are I guess). Not all breeders are bad! Many are great, lovely people, who truly care for animals. Others, however, see the newborn puppies as payday, and the mother as just a tool for profit. Puppy mills are a real thing, and It is disgusting. Places like Petland are well known for blatant neglect for their animals, as well as purchasing them from local backyard breeders. 
                    I would highly suggest avoiding them even for just pet supplies, as any purchase will support them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Ideally, the best place to find an animal would be a local pound or humane society. Our family just adopted the most adorable Belgium Malinois puppy from our local humane society. For less than $250 we gave an animal a loving home and hopefully a great, long, and happy life! 
                    These animals have no one to love or care for them and many would love to come home with you as soon as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now you have an idea of what you are looking for. You’ve looked at many breeds and decided what kind of dog you want, have the space for, and the funds to make it happen. Now its time for the final step:
				</p>
                <p>
                    <i><b>FINDING YOUR DOG!</b></i>
                </p>
				<p>
					I’m just as excited as you are! Really, I am! I love seeing animals find their furever families. Nothing warms my heart more than seeing a person loving on their four-legged companion. If you decide to go to a Humane society, ask the workers for someone to help you look around. Many of the people working these jobs have a passion for animals and would love to see them get adopted into loving homes. Someone there is sure to have tons of info on all the dogs, if you have kids be SURE TO ASK if they are good with children. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Especially if you are considering an older dog. One time, I found the most beautiful German Shepheard I’d ever seen. His coat was thick and lushes as a forest. He stood tall and mighty, with a ferocious bark that would shatter mountains. I would have done anything to take him home the second that I laid eyes on him. That is until Gary (the nicest man who knew every detail of every dog there) said he wouldn’t feel comfortable if he knew the dog would be around small children. 
                    Apparently, he just got back from staying with a foster family who gravely mistreated him. What once was a dog that stood among the greats, was now a shell of his former self.
				</p>
			<p>
				<i></i>
			</p>
				<p>
					Before, he was calm, happy, and got along with everyone. Now he wants to bite at people so much, he was busting his teeth on the cage trying to get ahold of anyone who walked by, leaving a trail of blood as he walked away. Now, I’m not saying the dog will never find a good home. He just needs to be reminded of what a loving family is like, but that would be a task better suited for a single person, or couple without children that could get hurt. 
                    The moral here is, I couldn’t offer that to him, so I had to walk away. No matter what there is always hope, but some tasks are best suited for others.
				</p>
				<p>
                    Now, back to finding your dog. You’ve walked around for an hour or so now, you’ve seen every dog in the facility. Maybe a few caught your eye, maybe one stood out the most, or maybe you didn’t really find one that was a match. It’s important to understand that it’s totally okay not to find the companion you are looking for on the first visit. Sometimes, it just takes time to find the right companion for you or your family. Never just settle on a pet, make sure it’s one you would fight for!
                     When you do find the one, you will know. You will have the most amazing feeling and your heart will scream this, this is my dog.
